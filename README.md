CCP WebGL Library
======
An implementation of CCP Games graphics engine in webgl.

This version of the library provides partial support for newer ships (no child effects or animations) and reading client resources, but requires a resource server to do so as ccp's servers do not provide CORS headers which webgl requires. [This server is not provided yet](https://github.com/cppctamber/ccpwgl2-server).


Core files
-----
* `dist/ccpwgl_int2.js`      - ccp webgl core library
* `dist/ccpwgl_int2.min.js`  - minified ccp webgl core library


Installation
------
1) Install  [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) along with the node package manager
2) Clone `git clone https://github.com/cppctamber/ccpwgl2.git`
3) Run `npm install` once from your ccpwgl folder


Demos
-----

*CCPWGL2*
These demos will not work without a server
* None supplied yet 



Configure resource server
------
Webgl requires CORS headers on any resources it loads (CCP's servers do not do this).
CCP's `.black` file format can be loaded directly from ccp's servers as they are not used directly by webgl, but resources cannot.
*This library doesn't provide this server.*


Configuring your server to be used by this library can be done in 4 different ways:

- Update the `src/config.js` file directly:
```
config.paths.cdn="https://localhost:3000"
```
 
- Set a new path: 
```
tw2.SetPath("cdn", "https://localhost:3000")
```

- Register a custom config object:
```
const customConfig = {
    ...,
    paths: { cdn: "https://localhost:3000" },
    ...
}
tw2.Register(customConfig);

```
- Set config during library initialization
```
tw2.Initialize({
    ...
    paths: { cdn: "https://localhost:3000 }
    ...
});
```


Build
-----
* Run `webpack` to lint, format and build `dist/ccpwgl2_int.js` and `dist/ccpwgl2_int.min.js` 
* Run `npm run watcher` to automatically rebuild `dist/ccpwgl2_int.js` and `dist/ccpwgl_int2.min.js` while developing
