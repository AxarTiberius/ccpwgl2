CCP WebGL Library
======
An implementation of CCP Games graphics engine in webgl.

This version of the library provides partial support for newer ships (no child effects or animations) and reading client resources but requires a resource server to do so (ccp's servers do not provide CORS headers which webgl requires). [This server is not provided yet](https://github.com/cppctamber/ccpwgl2-server).


Core files
-----
* `dist/ccpwgl_int2.js`      - ccp webgl core library
* `dist/ccpwgl_int2.min.js`  - minified ccp webgl core library


Installation
------
1) Install  [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) along with the node package manager
2) Clone `git clone https://github.com/cppctamber/ccpwgl2.git`
3) Run `npm install` once from your ccpwgl folder

Build
-----
* Run `webpack` to lint, format and build `dist/ccpwgl2_int.js` and `dist/ccpwgl2_int.min.js` 
* Run `npm run watcher` to automatically rebuild `dist/ccpwgl2_int.js` and `dist/ccpwgl_int2.min.js` while developing

Demos
-----
*CCPWGL*
These demos will work without a custom resource server.
* `demo/ccpwgl/ccpwgl.js`          - An example implementation of the ccp webgl library
* `demo/ccpwgl/index.html`         - A collection of ccpwgl demonstrations
* `demo/ccpwgl/sof.html`           - Shows how to load ships using Space Object Factory and how to query its data
* `demo/ccpwgl/planets.html`       - Shows how to load planets
* `demo/ccpwgl/sun.html`           - Shows how to load suns (lens flares)

These demos require a custom resource server
* None supplied yet 


Registering your custom resource server
------
Configuring the ccpwgl2 library to use your custom resource server can be done in a few ways:

- Register a custom config object:
```
const customConfig = {
    ...,
    paths: { cdn: "https://localhost:3000" },
    ...
}
tw2.Register(customConfig);

- Set the path by itself: 
```
tw2.SetPath("cdn", "https://localhost:3000")
```

- Set config during library initialization:
```
tw2.Initialize({
    ...
    paths: { cdn: "https://localhost:3000 }
    ...
});
```

```
