CCP WebGL Library
======
An implementation of CCP Games graphics engine in webgl.
1. This library can be used as is but with no support for models or features post 2016.
2. This library can be used to load the basic features of most models after 2016 but requires a proxy server to provide cors headers and some file conversions. This proxy server is not currently supplied.

Installation
------
1) Install  [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) along with the node package manager
2) Clone `git clone https://github.com/cppctamber/ccpwgl2.git`
3) Run `npm install` once from your ccpwgl folder

Define proxy server path
------
To load `.black` files and newer files resources your must defined a path to your your proxy server against the `cdn` prefix.

_This can be done in four ways:_

- Update the `src/config.js` file directly:
```
config.paths.cdn="https://localhost:3000
```
 
- Set a new path: 
```
tw2.SetPath("cdn", "https://localhost:3000)
```

- Register a custom config object:
```
const customConfig = {
    ...,
    paths: { cdn: "https://localhost:3000" },
    ...
}
tw2.Register(customConfig);

```
- Set config during library initialization
```
tw2.Initialize({
    ...
    paths: { cdn: "https://localhost:3000 }
    ...
});
```


Build
-----
* Run `webpack` to lint, format and build `dist/ccpwgl2_int.js` and `dist/ccpwgl2_int.min.js` 
* Run `npm run watcher` to automatically rebuild `dist/ccpwgl2_int.js` and `dist/ccpwgl_int2.min.js` while developing
